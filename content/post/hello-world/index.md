Welcome to the digital garden! I'm **ProsD**, a 22-year-old Backend Dev and SysAdmin from Italy. By day, I keep servers from catching fire; by night, I usually light them on fire myself (metaphorically... usually).

This blog is basically my external hard drive for all the rabbit holes I fall down. Here is the stack trace of my current obsessions:

- 💻 **Digital Necromancy (Reverse Engineering):** I enjoy the distinct pain of reading other people's compiled code to see how it works—or to make it do things the developers definitely didn't intend. To keep the lawyers away, I mostly focus on abandonware. If it's old enough to drink, it's old enough to be hacked.
- 🤖 **Homebrew Skynet (Local LLMs):** I work with AI professionally, which means I know exactly how much it costs to run. That is why I refuse to pay for tokens. I run everything locally on my own hardware because I'm a control freak who likes hearing my GPU fans sound like a jet engine at takeoff.
- 🛠️ **Hardware Hacking & Magic Smoke:** I own two 3D printers (FDM for structure, Resin for the fumes) and I know just enough electronics to be dangerous. I can't design a PCB from scratch, but I can absolutely duct-tape a devboard to a sensor and pray I don't electrocute myself. 
- 🎲 **Plastic Crack (TTRPGs/Warhammer):** When my eyes are bleeding from hex dumps, I touch grass. Just kidding, I go inside to paint tiny expensive soldiers or write D&D campaigns where my players inevitably derail the plot. Expect photos of minis and tales of critical failures.

## What's in the pipeline?

Who knows? Actually, I do, because I'm currently staring at a tracking number for some parts.

I have two projects loading into memory:

1. 🐪 **Resurrecting a Dinosaur:** I'm attempting to reverse engineer a 27-year-old game that hyperventilates if you try to run it on Windows 10+.
2. 👁️ **The Cyber-Bleep-Bloop:** Building a custom e-paper HUD for my MIDI controller because looking at a computer screen is apparently too mainstream.

Stay tuned. If I don't post for a while, assume the "hardware hacking" went wrong and I grounded the live wire.

See you, space cowboys. 🚀
